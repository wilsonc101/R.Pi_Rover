Deploys AWS infrastructure based on JSON formatted configuration file and deploy instances of 'ttyvehicle'.

To use:

1) Add PEM formatted key pair to security folder and adjust config/aws.cfg to match
2) Adjust tenancy.py so inbound rules containing <MY_IP_HERE> to match your source address or range
3) Add SQS key id and key to any 'init' scripts ingested by instances (if SQS is to be used)


The following example demonstrate the instantiation of the the 'ttyvehicle' simulator within multiple regions and the creation of the required SQS queues. 


Examples:

Config Global:
./config_global.py -j templates/ec2_usa-and-eu.json -s init-sim.sh -l logs/ec2.log 


Deploy Queues:
./deploy_queues.py -j templates/sqs_eu.json -s init-sim.sh -l logs/sqs.log
